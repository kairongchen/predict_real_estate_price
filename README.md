 Prediction of Residential Real Estate Prices

This is my first machine learning project for predicting real estate proces. The entire project is splited into five steps: exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, regression algorithm, and model training. I trained supervised learning models including Regressions, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. 

The project is part of the professional training program in Elite Data Science Academy.
